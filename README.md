# Address Book

This is a simple Address Book application I am building as part of learning Kotlin. Not much is happening, as of 23 October. The code is placing a few Person objects into the Address Book that can be viewed using the View All Contacts option from the menu. I have not yet implemented the other features, check back for further updates.
